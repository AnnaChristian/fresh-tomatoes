# Fresh Tomatoes

FreshTomatoes is a basic website to display movies information and trailers.

### Dependencies

 - Python 2.7: the Web page is generated by Python code.
You will need to have Python 2.7 installed.
 - Internet access: the Web page needs to access online libraries and other resources.
If you do not have Internet access, the page will not render correctly.

### Installation

1) Clone the Git project or extract the movies.tar.gz archive.

2) Change into the 'movies' directory (or the directory that contains the .py files) and run the e_center.py file, for example:

    ```sh
    $ python e_center.py
    ```

    This will create an fresh_tomatoes.html page and open it in your default web browser.

### Usage

This is a basic Udacity project page to display "favorite movies" data.
You can see the movie's box art, title, brief description, and click on the movie item to play the trailer.
You can also add properly formatted data to the data.json file and see your movies listed as well!
